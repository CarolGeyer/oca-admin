# OCA Open Project Governance

This document defines the project's community governance per 
[OASIS Open Projects Governance Policy](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/policy/project-governance.md).

## Overview

**OCA**, an OASIS Open Project, is building an open, inclusive, productive and 
self-governing open source community committed to developing an open cybersecurity ecosystem. 

The community is governed by this document and in accordance with 
[OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process) with the goal of defining 
how community can work together to achieve this goal.

## Code Repositories

The code repositories governed by the **OCA Open Project** community and maintained under 
here include:

* **[oca-admin](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oca-admin):** a repository 
containing administrative information regarding the Alliance.

## Community Roles

* **Contributors:** People who make regular contributions to our project (documentation, code 
reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.).
* **Maintainers**: People who have been selected by project leadership to oversee one or more 
components of the project, review code and PRs, prepare releases, triage issues, and similar tasks.

More information is available in the [OASIS Open Project handbook](https://www.oasis-open.org/oasis-open-projects-handbook).
